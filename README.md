STDS R code snippets that might be useful for others

All care and no responsibility is taken for the code. It works for me, but I won't guarantee it'll work for you. 
Please let me know if you use the code and find errors, or if you use the code and improve it. I am beginner level R coder and will take precisely zero offense to having my code corrected.
